        <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>2 cups ricotta cheese or cottage cheese</li>

      <p>Instructions</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and cook until al dente (firm) according to package directions. 
        Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or Dutch oven, brown the beef, sausage, onion, and garlic over medium-high heat until no pink remains. Drain any fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. Simmer uncovered over medium heat for 5 minutes or until slightly thickened. 
        Taste and season with additional salt if desired.</li>
        <li>In a separate medium bowl, combine 1 and a 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese, 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, ricotta, parsley, egg, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9X13 pan or casserole dish. Top it with 3 lasagna noodles. 
        Layer with 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat twice more. Finish with 3 noodles topped with remaining sauce.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and sprinkle the top of the lasagna with the remaining 2 and a 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Bake uncovered for an additional 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly.
        Broil for 2-3 minutes if desired.</li>
        <li>Rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting.</li>
